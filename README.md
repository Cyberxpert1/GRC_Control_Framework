# GRC_Control_Framework![IMG_20250123_235019](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89b85bd1-afb4-44a8-9e0b-60e2f80e2a39)
Executive Summary

The control framework described in this document is designed to establish a robust, sustainable, risk and security control framework that reduces risk, defines the security stance, and supports the organizational policy and directives. 

Executive Support and authority (Governance) is required for the creation of all controls and control activities in the control framework. Governance is initially established through policy. The Control Policies establish Governance, define Executive intent, and provide Control Owners with direction for evaluation and monitoring of controls and the delegation of roles and responsibilities. 

The controls in this framework are logically designed to address areas of IT risk that require secure, auditable, and sustainable control activities. These controls, and associated control activities, are required 

for IT operations that can introduce risk or increase risk potential due to either the complexity of the task, or the risk associated with the introduction of changes. For example, change management and patch 

management are areas that can introduce risk of a security breach, or result in unscheduled downtime if changes are unauthorized, untested, or unplanned. 

# The control framework achieves the following objectives: 

1. Reduces IT risk through the integration of risk management practices with IT operations and Services.

2. Protects organizational information and data assets by integrating cybersecurity with all IT activities.

3. Establishes Governance over controls through:

a. Executive support and authorization of Control policies that define controls and control activities.

b. Executive authorization of IT standards that support controls and control activities.

c. Identification and assignment of Control Owners for each Control, and Custodians for all control activities.

4. Continuous improvement through sustainability requiring regular reviews and reporting on effectiveness of control activities to Control Owners.

The framework will focus on the following controls: Risk Management, Security Management, Application Access, Change Management, Security Incident Handling and Response, Solution Acquisition and Development (DevSecOps), IT Disaster Recovery, Vulnerability Management, and Cybersecurity Awareness.

The controls are not developed in a silo. Each control will require involvement of Subject Matter Experts 

(SMEs) from across IT including the Custodians, Service Owners, and Cybersecurity experts. This ensures that policy, standards, process and procedures are developed by experienced individuals, iteratively, and 
with consensus. The Control Framework is also designed so that new controls can be inserted into the framework as required and new control activities can be added to individual controls with minimal impact.
