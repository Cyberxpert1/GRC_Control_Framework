# GRC_Control_Framework![IMG_20250123_235019](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89b85bd1-afb4-44a8-9e0b-60e2f80e2a39)
Executive Summary

The control framework described in this document is designed to establish a robust, sustainable, risk and security control framework that reduces risk, defines the security stance, and supports the organizational policy and directives. 

Executive Support and authority (Governance) is required for the creation of all controls and control activities in the control framework. Governance is initially established through policy. The Control Policies establish Governance, define Executive intent, and provide Control Owners with direction for evaluation and monitoring of controls and the delegation of roles and responsibilities. 

The controls in this framework are logically designed to address areas of IT risk that require secure, auditable, and sustainable control activities. These controls, and associated control activities, are required 

for IT operations that can introduce risk or increase risk potential due to either the complexity of the task, or the risk associated with the introduction of changes. For example, change management and patch 

management are areas that can introduce risk of a security breach, or result in unscheduled downtime if changes are unauthorized, untested, or unplanned. 

# The control framework achieves the following objectives: 

1. Reduces IT risk through the integration of risk management practices with IT operations and Services.

2. Protects organizational information and data assets by integrating cybersecurity with all IT activities.

3. Establishes Governance over controls through:

a. Executive support and authorization of Control policies that define controls and control activities.

b. Executive authorization of IT standards that support controls and control activities.

c. Identification and assignment of Control Owners for each Control, and Custodians for all control activities.

4. Continuous improvement through sustainability requiring regular reviews and reporting on effectiveness of control activities to Control Owners.

The framework will focus on the following controls: Risk Management, Security Management, Application Access, Change Management, Security Incident Handling and Response, Solution Acquisition and Development (DevSecOps), IT Disaster Recovery, Vulnerability Management, and Cybersecurity Awareness.

The controls are not developed in a silo. Each control will require involvement of Subject Matter Experts 

(SMEs) from across IT including the Custodians, Service Owners, and Cybersecurity experts. This ensures that policy, standards, process and procedures are developed by experienced individuals, iteratively, and 
with consensus. The Control Framework is also designed so that new controls can be inserted into the framework as required and new control activities can be added to individual controls with minimal impact.

# 1. Introduction
The Cybersecurity Control Framework integrates Policy, Standards, Risk and Procedures into a single structure and provides the building blocks for establishing a risk and security management program across all organizational IT operations. This document introduces general computing controls and a comprehensive set of risk based controls designed to support the implementation of a cost-effective risk and security management program. The Control framework provides the structure for achieving compliance in a logical manner and documents appropriate levels of governance for all control activities.

Figure 1 Control Framework

Policy provides the high level statements of management intent that are intended to provide direction and achieve desired outcomes of the business and executive. A set of directives should be created to 
establish the IT risk and security stance of an organization. Directives are what drive the need for, and creation of a control framework.

The Control Policies reinforce directives, establish governance, and ensure that risk and security is built into all IT controls. The policies are high level and define control objectives that address risk and security concerns associated with IT activities. Proactively addressing risk is the main reason for the control framework and to do this effectively means that governance, executive support and authorization for the controls must be established.

Control objectives are the statements describing the purpose of the control and ultimately the risk that is being addressed. It is the control objectives that define the requirements for specific technical standards, and the process and procedures to implement the standards. 

This Control Framework aligns with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), which has five key functions; Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover. These 

five functions provide a comprehensive view of the lifecycle for managing cybersecurity, over time. 

There are two or more of these NIST functions identified for each control activity. NIST defines the five 

# key functions as:

 Identify – Develop an organizational understanding to manage cybersecurity risk to systems, assets, data, and capabilities.

 Protect – Develop and implement appropriate safeguards to ensure delivery of services.

 Detect – Develop and implement the appropriate activities to identify the occurrence of a Cybersecurity event.

 Respond – Develop and implement the appropriate activities to take action regarding a detected cybersecurity event.

 Recover – Develop and implement the appropriate activities to maintain plans for resilience and to restore any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity event.

# All controls must have the NIST identify function which establishes the following: 
1. Governance for control activities.
2. Assessing and Managing Risk.
3. Understanding of organizational assets.
4. Cybersecurity roles and responsibilities.

Figure 2 NIST CSF Framework Functions
All controls require one or more of the Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover functions, depending on the control focus.
